# Lab 10

In this lab, we model heat diffusion. We have covered project question 9 and exercise 1 and 2 from A. Shiflet and G. Shiflet, 
*Introduction to Computational Science: Modeling and Simulation for the Sciences*, Princeton University Press.3, 276 (2006), Module 10.3.

___

The repository can be cloned on your local pc.
To run any of the .py files, use the following command in the terminal:

`python3 filename.py` 

For saving animations, you will require a movie writer. We have used ffmpeg, so if you have that installed, you should face no issues. Otherwise, you can install ffmpeg or use 
any other movie writer. 

___

The `images` folder contains graphs. The `animations` folder contains animation clips. 

`forest_periodic.py` simulates the basic model with periodic boundary conditions.

`forest_q9.py` simulates project question 9.

`forest_burn2.py` simulates exercise 1.

`forest_neigh_prop.py` simulates exercise 2.
