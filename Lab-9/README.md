# Lab 9
In this lab, we model heat diffusion. We have covered project questions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 from A. Shiflet and G. Shiflet, 
*Introduction to Computational Science: Modeling and Simulation for the Sciences*, Princeton University Press.3, 276 (2006), Module 10.2.

___

The repository can be cloned on your local pc.
To run any of the .py files, use the following command in the terminal:

python3 *filename.py* 

For saving animations, you will require a movie writer. We have used ffmpeg, so if you have that installed, you should face no issues. Otherwise, you can install ffmpeg or use 
any other movie writer. 

___

The *images* folder contains graphs for project Q4 - a and b. The *animations* folder contains animation clips of project 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. 

*diff_equilibrium.py* simulates project Q1's equilibrium condition while considering absorbing boundary conditions.

*diff_periodic.py* simulates periodic boundary conditions in heat diffusion.

*diff_reflecting.py* simulates reflecting boundary conditions in heat diffusion.

*diff_q1_b.py* simulates project Q1's part b.
___

### Weighted sum

*diff_q3.py* simulates project Q3 (weighted sum of neighbouring cells).

___ 

*diff_q4* simulates project Q4, part a. 

*diff_q4_b* simulates project Q4, part b.
___

### Stochastic heat diffusion
*diff_q9* simulates heat stochastic diffusion.
